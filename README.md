### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anjan, and I'm a junior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Data Science! 
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently the External Vice President at [Web Development at Berkeley](https://webatberkeley.org/), where I'm working on promoting fullstack web development education and development among studens on campus. I've also conducted research at [UCSF](https://honglab.ucsf.edu/), where I'm exploring the connections and biases between mental health diagnoses and socioeconomic background.
- This past summer, I worked as a SWE Intern on the Ground Truth Team at [Nuro](https://nuro.ai/), building machine learning infrastructure to improve the quality of labeling data for lidar cuboid projects.
