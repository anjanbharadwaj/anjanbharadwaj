### Hi there 👋

I'm Anjan, and I'm a rising senior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science. 
- 💸 This summer, I'm a software engineering intern at [Modern Treasury](https://moderntreasury.com/), a fintech startup building the future of money movement and payments operations.
- 🚗 This past spring, I worked as a software engineering intern on the Ground Truth Team at [Nuro](https://nuro.ai/), building machine learning infrastructure to power embedding search applications on our robots' behavior data.
- 🧑🏾‍💻 I'm currently a member at [Web Development at Berkeley](https://webatberkeley.org/), where I'm working on promoting fullstack web development education and development among students on campus. I've been in a plethora of roles — a backend developer, a product manager, and even served as President.
- 🔭 I've conducted research at [UCSF](https://honglab.ucsf.edu/), where I'm exploring the connections and biases between mental health diagnoses and socioeconomic background.
